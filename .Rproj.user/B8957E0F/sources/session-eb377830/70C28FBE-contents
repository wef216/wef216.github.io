I am Wei Fu. I am an assistant professor of health policy in the [Department of Health Management and Systems Sciences](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/wei-fu-phd){.external target="_blank"}, University of Louisville (UoFL). I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/){.external target="_blank"} in 2020. After that I went to the [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/){.external target="_blank"} at the University of Pennsylvania for post-doc trainings. During my trainings in [Wang Lab](https://www.lisanwanglab.org/){.external target="_blank"}, I developed my skill in analyzing human genetic data and interests in incoporating genetic data into health economics study.

My work is in applied econometrics, health economics, and labor economics. My research employs quantitative methods, such as causal inference methods and machine learning models, to inform evidence-based policymaking aimed at optimizing resource allocation, enhancing economic efficiency, and bolstering social resilience. Specifically, my research aims to assess the effects of public policies, such as unemployment insurance, food stamp programs, and vaccination policies, on individual's health behavior and labor market outcomes, with a substantive focus on disadvantaged populations. My work has been published in economics, public health, and medical journals, such as the *Economic Journal*, *Journal of Health Economics*, *Journal of Population Economics*, *American Journal of Agricultural Economcis*, *Social Science & Medicine*, and *JAMA Network Open*.

You can find my recent [CV](files/Wei-Fu-CV.pdf){.external target="_blank"} and [Papers](publications.qmd) here.
